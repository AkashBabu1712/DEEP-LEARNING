## Project Overview

This project aims to develop and evaluate deep learning models for [specific task, e.g., image classification, natural language processing, etc.]. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep-learning-project.git
cd deep-learning-project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Scripts

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    ```bash
    python preprocess_data.py --input-dir data/raw --output-dir data/processed
    ```

2. **Model Training**:
    ```bash
    python train_model.py --config configs/train_config.yaml
    ```

3. **Model Evaluation**:
    ```bash
    python evaluate_model.py --model-path models/model.pth --test-data data/processed/test
    ```

### Configuration

Edit the configuration files in the `configs/` directory to specify hyperparameters and other settings.

## Data

- **Raw Data**: Place your raw data in the `data/raw/` directory.
- **Processed Data**: The preprocessed data will be stored in the `data/processed/` directory.

Ensure you have the appropriate datasets in the `data/` directory before running the preprocessing script.

## Models

The models are defined in the `models/` directory. You can add or modify model architectures by editing the files in this directory.

## Training

To train a model, run the `train_model.py` script with the appropriate configuration file:

```bash
python train_model.py --config configs/train_config.yaml
```

Training logs and checkpoints will be saved in the `outputs/` directory.

## Evaluation

To evaluate a trained model, run the `evaluate_model.py` script:

```bash
python evaluate_model.py --model-path models/model.pth --test-data data/processed/test
```

The evaluation results will be saved in the `outputs/` directory.

## Results

The results of the training and evaluation processes, including metrics and visualizations, will be stored in the `results/` directory.
